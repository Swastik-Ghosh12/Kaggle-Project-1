# Kaggle-Project-1
This is my first Kaggle project that I completed. It is the Data Science London+Scikit learn project where we were given 1000 test samples and 9000 training samples.

RandomForestClassifier and Decision tree Classifier was used and it turns out Decision tree CLassifier has the best performance with a score of 1.0 while Random Forest Classifier had a score of 0.96
